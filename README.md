This is an application that can be used to search for data
on a Pokemon from the main series of the franchise. You can
use the search bar to enter the name of a pokemon and the 
drop down menu beside the search button to select the game
you want to retrieve from. It's meant to demonstrate our understanding of Martin Robert's Clean Code and it's principles such as TDD and DRY.
