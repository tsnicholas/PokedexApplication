This project was made to desmonstrate our understanding of Martin Robert's Clean Code and the principles it teaches such as TDD and DRY.
This application can be used to search for data
on a Pokemon from the main series of the franchise. You can
use the search bar to enter the name of a pokemon and the 
drop down menu beside the search button to select the game
you want to retrieve from. The application parses data from an open source API known as PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
